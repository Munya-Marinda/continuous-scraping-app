      content="This project aims to address the issue of server timeouts during web scraping by implementing a React app that performs continuous scraping. The app fetches a list of URLs to be scraped from the server, and even if the server times out, the app ensures that the data is still scraped. The scraping process is carried out by making repeated requests to the server, handling success and failure scenarios, and updating the logs accordingly."

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
